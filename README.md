# Maze generator

This maze generator will be using the recursive backtracking algorithm.

Here is a link where I found out about the algorithm: 
[RecursiveBacktrackingAlgorithm](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking)

## How to start up

* Firstly, to run the application, you will need an interpreter. I reccomend using VScode as that is the program I used when coding and testing the application.

* Ensure pip is installed, you should already have it installed if you have an up to date version of python.

* You will also need the turtle library installed.

* In the console, type in "pip install turtle".

* Once turtle is installed you will be able run the program which you can do in VScode by pressing F5.

* You will see a maze being generated using turtle

* Once the maze is generated, in order to end the program any key has to be input into the console.
